# Project Checkpoint 1

**Due Date: January 31, 2020**

## Overview

Setup the development environment for the project using [Rollup.js](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/).
Your project should be able to serve a default html page and include a JavaScript module from the `src/` folder.
This project is equivalent to the hello world demonstration shown in class.

## Requirements

 1. Project readme should be updated with build instructions.
 2. A `.gitignore` file should exist and `node_modules/` should be included.
 3. `npm run build` should build the project.
 4. `npm start` should start a local development server and serve the built project without errors.
 5. The JavaScript file in the project should add "Hello World" to the page.
 
## Turning in the Assignment

 1. Create a git branch for your work.
 2. Commit all applicable files to the branch and push the branch to your repository.
 3. Create a pull request targeting master to turn in the assignment.
 
You must both **push** your branch and **create a pull request** to turn in the assignment.
Both steps are required before the due date to be counted as on-time.
You should review the diff in the pull request and make sure what is included is expected.
